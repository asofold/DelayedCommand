Permissions: Ops always, otherwise (SuperPerms): delayedcommand.use 

Commands: 

* delayedcommmand (delayedcmd, dlcmd): 
   you can specify a <delay> in 1/20th of a second using -delay=<delay> as first argument, 
   the rest is the command to be executed. 
   Specifying no arguments results in no-operation (might also be useful).
